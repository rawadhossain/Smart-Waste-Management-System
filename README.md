# 🌍 Overview

**BinSync** is a **Smart Waste Management System** designed to improve city waste collection efficiency using **IoT-enabled smart bins** and **role-based dashboards**.

The system collects **sensor data from smart bins**, calculates **fill levels**, and helps authorities optimize waste collection operations.

### Goals

- ♻️ Reduce unnecessary waste collection trips
- 📊 Monitor bin fill levels in real time
- 🚛 Optimize driver routes
- 🗺 Provide public visibility of bin locations
- 📡 Integrate hardware sensor data

---

# 👥 User Roles

The system provides **role-based access control** with different dashboards.

| Role            | Description                                           |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 👑 **Admin**    | System configuration, user management, bin management |
| 🖥 **Operator** | Monitor bins and schedule waste collection            |
| 🚛 **Driver**   | View assigned routes and perform waste pickup         |

---

# 📡 Hardware Status

The smart bin hardware is already implemented and generating **fill-level logs**.

Example device log:

```text
2025-12-14 22:13:56 | Distance: 34.8 cm | Fill: 55%
```

These logs are used to calculate:

- Bin fill percentage
- Collection priority
- Historical waste trends

---

# ✨ Features

Separate dashboards for **Admin**, **Operator**, and **Driver**.

## 🗺 Public Waste Map

Public users can see **bin locations and status** on a map.

## 🚛 Driver Route Management

Drivers can view **assigned waste collection routes**.

## 📡 Hardware Log Integration

The system reads and processes sensor-generated fill logs.
